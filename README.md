# express-debug
express-debug is a development tool for [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express). It's simple middleware that
injects useful debugging output into your html, in a non-obstructive way.

It adds an 'EDT' tab to the right side of pages that, when clicked, displays info
such as template variables (locals), current session, useful request data, and
current template.

If your application doesn't serve HTML, no worries, a standalone express-debug
panel is mounted at `/express-debug`. See settings section for more information.

express-debug should **NOT** be used in production environments.

**Compatible with express 3.x and node 0.8+**

### Usage

#### Install
`npm install express-debug --save-dev`

#### Use
```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.configure('development', function() {
    var edt = require('express-debug');
    edt(app, {/* settings */});
});

/* ... application logic ... */
```


### Settings

`depth` - How deep to recurse through printed objects.
(Default: `4`)

`theme` - Absolute path to a css file to include and override EDT's default css.

`extra_panels` - additional panels to show. [See docs for custom panels](https://github.com/devoidfury/express-debug/blob/master/docs/custom_panels.md) and
[included panels](https://github.com/devoidfury/express-debug/tree/master/lib/panels)
for proper structure, each panel is an object
(Default: `[]`)

`panels` - allows changing the default panels (ex: remove a panel)
(Default: `['locals', 'request', 'session', 'template', 'software_info', 'profile']`)

`path` - path to render standalone express-debug \[set to `null` or `false` to disable\]
(Default: `/express-debug`)

### Panels

`locals` - app.locals, res.locals, and options passed to the template (merged into res.locals)

`request` - req info. ip, body, query, files, route info, cookies, headers

`session` - everything in req.session

`template` - view name, template file

`software_info` - shows current versions of node and libraries installed locally (not globally installed packages!)

`profile` - total req processing time. middleware, param, and route timings.

`other_requests` - shows details on non-page requests made to the server (not a default panel, use extra_panels setting to invoke. `{extra_panels: ['other_requests']}`)

`nav` - links to every GET route in your app. (not a default panel)

### Caveats
* This module will not work if you explicitly define `app.use(app.router);`

### Future
* optional error page that prints better stacks
* save more information about non-injected requests
* improve styling
